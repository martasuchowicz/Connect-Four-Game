# Connect Four Game

Connect Four is a variation on the Connect Four game. One of the first big projects from my bootcamp at Spiced Academy in Berlin.

# Tech

HTML, CSS and JavaScript / jQuery

# Features

* The board has six rows and seven columns

* Two players take turns selecting a column to drop their checker into

* When a player wins, a message appears to announce the victory

# Goals while doing the project

1. Learn to handle game logic in JS / jQuery and interactive elements

2. Make animations with CSS (for victories, UI etc.)
